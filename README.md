# Netflix Landing Page Clone

This was an exciting project where we got to test out our replication skills and learn more HTML and CSS tools.

Key takeaways from this project:
- analyze and plan out the layout of the webpage so you can have an idea of your HTML structure
- pay attention to detail
- don't use relative and absolute positioning carelessly as this could disturb the flow of the page
- W3 Schools and other free resources are your best friend! Always be eager and willing to learn
